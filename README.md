# eloquentJavaScript

My solutions to Marijn Haverbeke's popular E-Book "Eloquent JavaScript". Although solutions are posted online by the author, I find it helpful to see other examples and solututions to a problem. This is because there doesn't exist a single solution to a problem, and oftentimes textbook answers to problem sets have been refactored and polished, thereby lacking the rawness that a solution that a learner might put forth when grappling with some subject for the first time.
